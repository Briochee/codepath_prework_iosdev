## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
 -instagram, snapchat, (most social media apps): the ability to quickly message friends and family, from long stories to short recaps
 -pokemon go: (i assume) they implement object oriented programming to make a detailed and meticulious game
 -wikipedia: simple and on-brand UI, few ads
 -facetime: concept, i enjoy the ability to call and see those close to me
 -any app with a dark mode
 -spotify: great app, decent UI design, spotify wrapped -- making a personal review of related data (users music choice)

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
  xcode did not properly display labels and button after running, restarted xcode to fix this
